                <h2>Bio</h2>

                <p>
                    Right now I'm a
                    senior
                    at
                    Columbia University,
                    graduating with a B.A. in Computer Science in May 2020

                    <p>
                        I most recently interned as Software Engineer and Analyst at Computers Unlimited, a
                        medical tech company based out of Billings, MT.
                        <br>
                        In addition to tech, I also have a lot of interest in the humanities!
                        I have volunteered for political activism groups, taught an intro to computer science class in
                        my hometown in Montana, and am actively
                        looking for ways to use my education to provide a positive impact in others' lives.

                        <p>
                            This website serves as a more in-depth look at my experiences and career. For a more brief
