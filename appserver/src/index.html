All of the best computer scientists I know have websites that are pretty much just html. So, y'know what they say, "Dress for the job you want."

Also lol welcome to anyone who is looking at the source html, the Konami code may do something :)

<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
My name is Layne Britton. 
I am a
senior
at
Columbia University
pursuing a B.A. in computer science.

<p>
I am currently working as a Software Engineer and Analyst Intern at Computers Unlimited, a company based out of Billings, MT. 
In addition to tech, I have a lot of interest in the humanities as well. 
I have volunteered for political activism groups, taught an intro to computer science class in my hometown in Montana, and am actively
looking for ways to use my education to provide a positive impact in others' lives.
